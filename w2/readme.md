There are many projects that I have though of creating in the past but I think that I would enjoy the process of creating a bot the most. I do not know much about bots but I have heard that bots can be used to buy items that sell fast. The number one items that I have in mind to buy are computer chips and graphics cards. I have been hoping to buy these computer parts for a while but they always seems to sell out quickly. A bot would be helpful since I would not have to keep monitoring the websites and right when they are on stock the bot can but the computer parts. The only issue is that I am not sure if the websites have an antibot algorithm such as the "I am not a robot" algorithm. I don't know how complex it is to create a bot like this but it would be fun project and it would offer a lot to learn.

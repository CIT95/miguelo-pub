## Turtler
For my learn_together I decided to replicate a game called frogger. To get this project done I created comments on my project that I had to do. Sometimes I moved the comments around since they flowed better and sometimes I added or deleted some. I created a lot of what I wanted to but there were somethings that were out of my control. For example the screen lagged when any of the turtles moved. I think that the lag came from how Turtle is programmed or my own computer not able to keep up. I feel like this was a fun project to work on and hopefully I will add more in the future.
